# Hospital Management System | Java, File Handling, Object-Oriented Programming

## Description
Developed a console-based **Hospital Management System** to efficiently manage patient records, doctor details, and appointment scheduling. Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** — Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism — to design a modular and maintainable system. Utilized **Java File Handling** for persistent storage and **Exception Handling** to ensure robust input and file operations without database dependency.

## Key Features
- **Patient Management:** Registration, record management, and history tracking  
- **Doctor & Department Management:** Store and manage doctor and department information  
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments  
- **Persistent Storage:** Data stored in text files using Java I/O streams  
- **User Interface:** Menu-driven console interface for easy and intuitive navigation

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- File Handling (I/O Streams)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Exception Handling
