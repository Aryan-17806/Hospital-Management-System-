#Hospital Management System | Java, File Handling, Object-Oriented Programming |
Description:
Developed a console-based Hospital Management System to efficiently manage patient records, doctor details, and appointment scheduling. Applied OOP principles — Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism — to design a modular and maintainable system. Utilized Java File Handling for persistent storage and Exception Handling to ensure robust input and file operations without database dependency.
Key Features:
•	Patient registration, record management, and history tracking.
•	Doctor and department information management.
•	Appointment scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation.
•	Persistent data storage using Java I/O streams in text files.
•	Menu-driven console interface for intuitive navigation.
